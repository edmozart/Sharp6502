# Ed6502
A MOS 6502 processor emulator written in C#

Ed6502 is a C#-based emulator for the MOS 6502 CPU, developed primarily for learning emulation and low-level programming/debugging. Currently only the standard instruction set is implemented, including decimal mode. (No illegal opcodes or extensions).
It was tested and validated against the test program below:
